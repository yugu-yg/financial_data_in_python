    "# Working with Financial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note, we will learn how to work with financial data. Our goal is twofold. First, we will learn the mechanics and syntax of working with data in `python` -- which command does what, and what code you need to write to produce a certain analysis or make a certain plot. Second, we will learn a _data workflow_, which is an overall approach to importing, arranging, modifying, analyzing, and visualizing data that is not specific to a particular programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will accomplish all of this by following an example. Our goal will be to assess the historical stock performance of several large companies, and then to see whether this performance is explained well by the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** that you learned in your investments class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first things first. Earlier, we learned about various libraries that we use to accomplish certain things in `python`. For working with data, our go-to library will be `pandas`, commonly abbreviated to (\"aliased\" as) `pd`. This library will provide us with two _data structures_ -- `Series` and `DataFrame`. We can think of them as being `pandas` analogs to vectors and matrices from `numpy`, but with some extra bells and whistles (e.g. row and column labels, ability to store non-numeric and missing data, etc.) that make them better suited for working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the library.\n"

    "Broadly speaking, data can come from three sources. First, and least commonly, we can enter data directly in our code. Second, we can import data from a file, whether stored locally on our computer or on some server elsewhere. There are many formats in which data can be stored in a file. The most common and widely compatible format for tabular data (i.e. tables) is comma-separated values (CSV) files, which are regular text files which use commas to separate columns and line-breaks to separate rows. Third, we can import data from a remote source (e.g. a website). Many data providers make data available through interfaces especially designed for computers to access them programmatically (through a program) as opposed for users to access them interactively (i.e. by visiting a website in a web browser). These interfaces are called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and instructions for how to use them vary from provider to provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we will explore importing financial and economic data using a few common APIs. But for now, let's focus on the second method -- importing data from a CSV file.\n",

    "The `print()` function just prints `s`, and the `type()` command returns the data structure type. As you can see, this is no longer a `DataFrame` but a `Series`, the univariate data structure supplied by `pandas`. While `Series` only have one column while `DataFrames` can (but don't necessarily have to, as we saw above) have multiple columns, in practice the two data structures are very similar. Most methods that work for one work for another. One difference is that if we want to refer to rows by their number, we can do so directly for a `Series` whereas we have to use the `iloc` property for a `DataFrame`.

    "Now that we've seen what works, let's talk about what doesn't. `df.index[0] + 15` gives an error because `pandas` doesn't know what \"15\" means -- is it days, seconds, or something else? `pd.Timedelta(days=15)` makes the unit of the time interval clear. `pd.Timedelta(months=2)` doesn't work either. The longest unit available to `Timedelta` is a day because larger units are ambiguous. Months can have 28, 30, or 31 days. Years can have 365 or 366 days. So it is unclear what specific time interval you mean if you say \"1 month.\"\n",

    "The `plot()` method takes two arguments -- a set of x coordinates and a set of y coordinates -- and constructs a plot `object`. I use the word \"set\" loosely here. It can be a `python` list, a `numpy` one-dimensional ndarray, or a `pandas` series. You can check that `plot()` works with all of this by converting the `pandas` objects `df.index` index or the `df['close']` series to a `numpy` array using `.to_numpy()` or to a `python` list using `.tolist()`. For example, try `plt.plot(df.index.to_numpy(), df['close'].tolist())`. You will get the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `show()` method displays this object. Why would you ever want to construct a plot but not show it? Maybe because your goal is to print many graphs to a file e.g. a PDF and you don't want your program to litter your screen with dozens of plot windows as it runs.\n",
    "\n",

    "We plotted two different lines on the same set of axes by issuing two `plot()` commands. Each line received a `label`, which we then displayed using the `legend()` method in the upper-left-hand corner of the plot. We turned on grid lines. For the `open` plot, we also changed its line style from the default solid to a dashed line by specify `'--'` as the third argument.\n",

    "The most interesting line is probably `plt.axhline(y=df.loc[min(df.index)==df.index,'close'].values[0],color='g')`, which plots a horizontal green line at the level of the earliest closing price to help us compare subsequent prices with the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine this line closely. The `axhline()` method draws a horizontal line at a level specified by the value of the `y` argument. Its green color is given by the `color='g'` argument. To identify the closing price at the start of the dataset, we have several options. Recall that earlier we noticed that the data seemed to be in reverse order, with most recent observations first. We could assume that this is indeed true, in which case the last row of the data would be earliest, so we could have defined `y` to be `df['close'][-1]`. But this is not a good idea, because we have not done anything to make sure that the data is indeed sorted in reverse order, so we are effectively relying on the data provider to supply the data in a certain order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more robust to select the closing price that explicitly corresponds to the earliest date i.e. to select the value of `close` in the row whose date index is equal to the earliest date, or the minimum of all the dates. We select this value with\n"

    "We did a few things differently the second time around. First, rather than storing a vector of `True`s and `False`s in the filter variable, we stored the dates (as `pandas` indices) directly. This made the `plot()` command simpler because we can plot `filter_dates` directly as x-values and, because we mades dates `df`'s index earlier, we can pass them to `.loc()` to extract the corresponding closing prices directly. This is a good example of how useful indices can be for filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the plot. It seems that over the course of February 2002, Microsoft's stock price fell from about 48 to about 24. Microsoft stock price halved. Did the company really lose half its value? Seems unlikely. What is more likely is that it underwent a 2-for-1 split. In other words, the company gave all existing shareholders 2 new shares worth \\\\$24 in exchange for 1 old share worth \\\\$48. Do we want this reflected as a big drop in the stock price in our graph? If all we want to plot is the level of the stock price, sure. But usually, the point of working with stock prices is looking at which investments performed well and which performed poorly. An investment in Microsoft did not\n",
    "lose half its value in February 2003. It was just redenominated. If I gave you two \\\\$10 bills in exchange for one \\\\$20, you did not lose \\\\$10, did you?\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we actually want to plot isn't the headline stock price at the end of the month but rather the increase in value of a hypothetical investment in Microsoft from December 1999 until today. And the history of closing prices does not accomplish this goal because prices go down in response to stock splits and dividends, while the value of one's investment does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, good data providers of historical stock data include another column, which allow us to plot what we want. Some include a column called \"return\" or \"total return,\" which represents the increase in the value of the investment between two dates inclusive of splits and dividends. Others _adjust_ the closing price, such that the most recent _adjusted closing price_ is the same as the actual closing price, but past prices are different (usually lower) than what they actually have been, such that the ratio of two consecutive adjusted closing prices represents the total return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset follows the latter approach. Let's see how a plot of the adjusted closing price looks like in the 2002-2003 period.\n"

    "`sort_values()` takes at least one argument, which is the name(s) of columns by which we are sorting. Note that here we can still refer to our index by its original column name `timestamp`. Optional arguments allow one to sort ascending (default) or descending, determine whether to collect missing data at the beginning or the end (default), and finally to produce a new dataset (default) or sort the existing one. We don't need to separately keep unsorted and sorted dataset in memory, so we sort it \"in-place,\" meaning we sort the existing dataset. When working with large datasets, performing as many operations \"in-place\" can significantly speed up your code, keep your computer memory free, and prevent crashes, because it avoids duplicating the dataset.\n",

    "## Computing and Analyzing Stock Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the `adjusted close` column is defined such that the ratio of two closing prices represents the gross return between these two dates. For example, the gross return between Dec 31, 1999 and Jan 31, 2000 is the `31.0176 / 37.0012`. This is the return an investor in Microsoft would have received if she bought a share at market close on Dec 31 and held it for the entire month of January until Jan 31. In other words, it is the Jan 2000 monthly return. Similarly, the Feb monthly return is `28.3237 / 31.0176`. Typically, we think in terms of net returns. So, for example, the Jan return would be `31.0176 / 37.0012 - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute monthly returns for all of our observations, except for the first one. Why not? Well, to get the Dec 1999 return, we'd need to know the Nov 1999 adjusted closing price, and it is not in our dataset. Of course, if Microsoft was publicly traded in Nov 1999, we can find a different data source and look it up, but then we'd have the same problem with the Nov 1999 return -- we would not be able to compute it because we don't have the Oct 1999 closing price, and so on. It is always the case that given a series of $N$ prices, we can compute $N-1$ returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of operation naturally lends itself to vectorization because we need to perform the same calculation $N-1$ times. If we were doing this with `numpy` arrays, we would have to think about numeric indices carefully, and then deal with the fact that we have one fewer return than price when storing the result back in the dataframe. But because we've `df.set_index()`, `pandas` lets us not worry about any of that:\n"

    "We selected the two columns we're interested in -- returns and log returns -- and `describe()`d them to get the number of observations (`count`), mean, standard deviation (`std`), extrema (`min` and `max`), and a few key percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that Microsoft's monthly returns have had about 8.2% volatility and a mean of... either 1.17% or 0.84%, depending on which column you look at. So which column should it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with any statistic, the answer depends on the question you are asking. If someone asks you what the average return for Microsoft has been, you should clarify -- why do you want to know? Typically, someone is interested in historical stock returns because they want to gauge how much money they could have or can make. Maybe the person asking you is interested in how much they could expect to make over the next month if they invested in Microsoft today and the probability distribution of its returns remained unchanged. This question is best answered by looking at the first column of simple `ret`urns -- about 1.17%.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, more commonly, one wants to know the average return because they would like to know much they would earn on average per month if they held the investment for a while. Another way of asking this question is: if I invested a risk-free investment that delivered the same return every month, what would that return need to be for me to earn the same amount as if I had invested in Microsoft stock?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that question is **not** 1.17%. To see why, consider investing \\\\$100 in a hypothetical (very risky!) stock and holding the stock for two months. In the first month, the stock experiences a 50\\% return. In the second month, it experiences a -50\\% return. The *arithmetic average* return is $(0.5 - 0.5) / 2 = 0$. The cumulative return over two months, however, is $(1 + 0.5) \\times (1 - 0.5) -1 = -0.25$ or -25\\%. At the end of the first month, your investment is worth \\\\$150, so the negative 50\\% return in the second month is applied to a bigger base. The same 50\\% change loses you \\\\$75 instead of \\\\$50.\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent risk-free investment would need to earn $x$ every month to deliver a cumulative return of $(1+x)^2-1=-0.25$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1-(1-0.25)^\\frac{1}{2}=-0.134$ or -13.4\\% per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the answer to \"if I invested a risk-free investment that delivered the same return every month, what would that return need to be for me to earn the same amount as if I had invested in this stock\" is the _geometric mean_ of -13.4\\%. not 0\\%!\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric mean of returns $R_{t+1}, R_{t+2}, \\ldots, R_{t+h}$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 1 + \\bar{R}_{t\\rightarrow t+h}^{geom} \\equiv \\left[ (1+R_{t+1}) (1+R*{t+2}) \\ldots (1 + R*{t+h}) \\right]^\\frac{1}{h} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks messy, but log returns come to the rescue. Plugging in the definition of log returns and doing some math, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 1 + \\bar{R}_{t\\rightarrow t+h}^{geom} = \\exp( \\frac{r_{t+1} + r*{t+2} \\ldots + r*{t+h}}{h} )$\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the expression inside $\\exp()$. This is just the regular arithmetic mean of log returns, which we can denote $\\bar{r}_{t \\rightarrow t+h}$. So the geometric mean of returns is just an exponentiated version of the arithmetic mean of log returns. And since we know that $\\log(1+x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$ (which _mean_ log returns usually are), the geometric mean is very well approximated by the arithmetic mean of log returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the second column in our table of summary statistics is useful. Let's use the mean log return to compute the geometric mean exactly:\n"

    "Note that the two methods of computing the geometric mean -- using log returns and directly -- produce identical results. The mean log return is very close to the geometric mean -- enough that, again, we can use them interchangeably. And all are substantially lower than the mean return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the geometric mean is **always** lower than the arithmetic mean, and this difference increases in volatility. This is why unscrupulous asset managers want to advertise the arithmetic mean of their strategies. This way, to naive investors they can seem to offer large returns while actually all they're doing is offering more risk for the same return.\n",

    "### Aside: The Distribution of Log Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "In other classes, you may have assumed, or will assume, that returns are log-normally distributed, or, in other words, log returns are normally distributed. One nice property of the normal family of distributions is that any normal distribution is fully described by two parameters identifying its mean and standard deviation. So if log returns are indeed normally distributed, then the mean and standard deviation estimated above fully describe their distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check if this is the case. Let us plot, on the same plot, two probability density functions (pdfs). The first will be the pdf of the normal distribution with a mean of 0.0083891 and a standard deviation of 0.082189, the statistics for log returns in our sample. The second will be a histogram of the data, scaled to resemble a pdf.\n"

    "Notice that the data doesn't look _that_ normally distributed. Sure, the overall pattern is there -- there is a single peak and most of the mass of the distribution is clustered around that peak. But it's not very symmetric, and extreme returns, whether positive or negative, occur more often than the normal distribution would suggest. Later in this course, when we discuss modeling stock returns, we will explore ways to relax the assumption of normality.\n"

    "### Aside: Adding Stats to `DataFrame.describe()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, there are other statistics we would like to see in addition to count, mean, std.dev., and percentiles. For instance, with financial time series we are often interested in their autocorrelation. And to evaluate the non-normality of returns, we may want to report the sample's skewness or kurtosis. There is no argument of `DataFrame.describe()` that allows us to add stats. But we can write our own function that \"wraps\" `DataFrame.describe()` and augments its output with additional statistics.\n"

    "The `describe()` function takes two arguments -- a `DataFrame` and a `list` of statistics in the format that `DataFrame.agg()` expects. We take advantage of the fact that `DataFrame.describe()` is already essentially a shorthand for `agg` -- a really useful `pandas` function that produces summary statistics. We can think of `DataFrame.describe()` as calling `DataFrame.agg()` with a specific pre-specified list of statistics. We are just adding a few more and `DataFrame.concat()`enating the two sets of summary statistics together. The last part -- `.drop_duplicates()` -- just deals with the possibility that we accidentally asked for a statistic that `DataFrame.describe()` already outputs.\n"

    "Relative to how Microsoft's table looked, we see a new column at the beginning -- `ticker` -- indicating which company's information the row (\"obsetvation\") contains. It identifies the observation along with `timestamp`. If we just knew that the stock return is from August 2021, that wouldn't tell us enough information. Is it the August return for C (Citi) or for XOM (Exxon Mobil)? Every observation in this data -- every closing price, dividend amount, etc. -- has two _dimensions_: a ticker and a month. Both are necessary to identify it. Such two-dimensional data is sometimes called _panel_ data if one of the dimensions is time, like it is here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to store such two-dimensional observations. The format above contains a separate row for every combination of `ticker` and `timestamp` for which we have data. In other words, every obseration has its own row. This format is called the _long_ format. An alternative _wide_ format would use rows to identify one dimensions -- e.g. month -- and use columns to identify the other dimension -- ticker. It would look something like this:\n"

    "When you want to look at the data, the wide format seems more appealing. You can easily scan across a row and see what the stock prices were for different companies on a given day.\n",

    "But as a way of storing and manipulating data, wide format has a few shortcomings. Notice that it can only store one piece of information for every company-date. The above table displays the adjusted closing price. What if we also wanted to know the volume? We'd need another table -- we're already using rows to identify dates and columns to identify tickers so we don't have another dimension to identify variable i.e. adjusted close or volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to find out the total dollar amount traded that day, approximately equal to close \\* volume. With long data, it would just be a matter of multiplying the two columns. But with wide format data, we'd need to have two tables, ensure that the order of dates and tickers is exactly the same, and then multiply their entire contents by each other. There are lots more opportunities to make a mistake here!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other shortcomings are additional difficulties in performing the same operation for every ticker, and \"wasted space\" created by imposing a balanced structure on potentially unbalanced data. For example, notice the `NaN` (not-a-number, or missing) values for the first few months of C. That's because we don't have data for Citigroup's stock prices for those months. Our panel is _unbalanced._ In the long data, those rows are just missing. But wide data is inherently a balanced representation, so we end up with these `NaN`s.\n",

    "We see that over the 20 year period there are huge differences between how these stocks performed. Microsoft was the best performer with an average annual log return of 12.7% while Citi was the worst, losing about 7% of its value on average every year. Our best that tech stocks would perform non-tech stocks turned out to be true, but just barely. Long-short portfolio earnes less than 1% per year on average with still substantial volatility of 18.8%. The equal-weighted portfolio does better, earning a 6% average annual return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part of the code above, we annualized the statistics and converted them to percent. For means, this is straightforward -- just multiply the monthly return by 12 (months in a year). For standard deviations, the square root should be familiar from your statistics and Investments classes. If not, here's a quick refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset Return Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we defined $r_{t\\rightarrow t+1}$ as the log return from time $t$ to time $t+1$, where time $t$ is in units of months. The annual return then is the cumulative return over 12 months:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{y\\rightarrow y+1} = \\sum_{m=1}^{12} r_{y:m-1\\rightarrow y:m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 2019 annual log return is the sum of Jan 2019, Feb 2019, ... Dec 2019 monthly log returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each monthly return as a sample from a random variable. Note, here I am assuming that each month's return has the same distribution i.e. that monthly returns are identically distributed. Within a year, this assumption holds quite well in the data. We know the sample mean and standard deviation of monthly returns, which are estimators for the expected value $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the distribution. We can use formulas we know from Statistics to calculate the expected value and standard deviation of the annual return because the annual return is just a sum of identically distributed random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the expected value, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[r_{y\\rightarrow y+1}] = \\sum_{m=1}^{12} E[r_{y:m-1\\rightarrow y:m}] = \\sum_{m=1}^{12} \\mu = 12 \\mu$\n",
    "\n",
    "just like in the code above. To compute the standard deviation, let us first compute the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Var}[r_{y\\rightarrow y+1}] = \\text{Var}\\left[\\sum_{m=1}^{12} r_{y:m-1\\rightarrow y:m}\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, generally, it is not true that the variance of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual variances. Usually, there are covariance terms present. But when it comes to stock returns, we can rely on the Efficient Market Hypothesis to make another assumption -- that stock returns are uncorrelated over time i.e. that knowing the January stock return does not help you predict the February return. This assumption holds well in the data -- notice that the autocorrelations in the table above are usually pretty close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption of no correlations, all the covariances are equal to zero. Only in this case, we can write the variance of a sum as a sum of variances:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Var}[r_{y\\rightarrow y+1}] = \\sum*{m=1}^{12} \\text{Var}[r*{y:m-1\\rightarrow y:m}] = \\sum\\_{m=1}^{12} \\sigma^2 = 12 \\sigma^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{std}[r_{y\\rightarrow y+1}]] = \\sigma \\sqrt{12} $\n",
    "\n",
    "which is why we multiplied by `np.sqrt(MONTHS_PER_YEAR)` above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another look at the summary statistics, but this time using a mean-variance plot of the type you've seen in your Investment class:\n"

    "We can see that in general it seems like riskier stocks command higher returns, though there are some significant outliers like GE and especially C.

    "But of course to gauge stock performance it's not enough to compare average returns to its volatility. Recall, there is not much reason for investors to care about volatility itself if that volatility is idiosyncratic i.e. if it is not correlated with the volatility of the investors' overall portfolio, which we usually measure using the aggregate market portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic is formalized in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which you learned in your Investments class. Recall that the CAPM states that excess returns (returns in excess of the risk-free rate) of a particular asset are proportional to the excess return on the market. The coefficient of proportionality $\\beta_i$ is specific to each asset and is referred to as the asset's beta.\n",

    "Since the market excess return is positive on average, the CAPM implies that stocks with higher betas should have higher excess returns. Rather than compare stock returns to volatilities, we should compare stock returns to their betas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate an asset's beta by running the following regression for each asset $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ r*{i,t+1} - r*{f,t} = \\alpha*i + \\beta_i (r*{m,t+1} - r*{f,t} ) + \\epsilon*{i,t+1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will need two pieces of data that we haven't yet used -- market returns, and risk-free rates, which we will use to compute excess returns. There are many sources for these data, but one easy and free place to get them from is the website of Ken French, a finance professor at Dartmouth and one of the authors of the famous Fama-French model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually a Python package called `pandas_datareader` that can download these data directly! Before running the cell below for the first time, install it by opening your terminal (on Mac) or CMD.EXE (on Windows, from the Anaconda dashboard) and run `pip install pandas-datareader`.\n",

    "This table is indexed by a monthly Date, and has four columns. `Mkt-RF` is the market excess return (market return minus risk-free rate). `RF` is the risk-free rate. The other two columns `SMB` and `HML` contain returns on two long-short portfolios that serve as additional factors in the Fama-French model. We won't be using them today.\n",

    "The units in this table are unclear, but we can use some common sense and our general knowledge of stock returns and interest rates to figure them out. First, the fact that some returns are smaller than -1 suggests that they are in percent. Remember: limited liability means that you can never lose more than 100% of your investment i.e. experience a worse than -1 return.\n",

    "Now, we want to combine `returns` and `kfdf` so that we can subtract the correct risk-free rate from each of our asset returns to get excess returns. Recall, our `returns` dataframe has one row for each date and ticker. So for example, there are 12 rows corresponding to July 2000 -- one for each company. The data starts in July 2000 and goes until October 2021. In contrast, `kfdf` has only one row for each date, and the date goes through August 2022, almost a year later than `returns`. We have no use for these recent data on risk-free rates and market excess returns, because we don't have the corresponding returns on the assets, whose performance we are trying to assess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our goal is to perform a **many-to-one** **inner join**. Let's talk about each of these terms separately. The \"many-to-one\" is referring to us merging many rows in `returns` -- 12 for each date -- to one row in `kfdata`. The \"inner join\" part is referring to the fact that we only want to keep observations for dates present in both tables. If we wanted to keep observations that don't have a match in the other dataset, we would do an **outer join**. If our preference towards keeping or discarding non-matching observations differs by dataset, we can keep them only from the first (left) or the second (right) dataset by doing a left, or right, join respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do this merge, we have another problem to deal with. The the way dates are expressed in the two datasets are different. The index of `returns` is a daily date in `datetime` format. The index of `kfdf`, however, is\n"

    "Period indices are a really useful `pandas` feature because they allow us to identify dates at a particular frequency, not necessarily daily. This can be very helpful if you want to offset your data by a given number of months, regardless of which month you're starting in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easier to see with an example. Suppose your monthly observation is labeled with a particular date e.g. April 1, 2021. What is one month before then? Well, that depends -- months have different lengths. Do you want to always subtract 31? 30? 28 or 29? If you subtract 31 days from April 1, you get March 1. But if you subtract 31 from March 1, you get a day in January, skipping February altogether! Maybe you want to subtract the correct number of days for a given month e.g. 31 here because March has 31 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "This gets tricky. And also unnecessary. We don't really care about the day of the month, so why keep track of it and deal with all the associated problems. A `PeriodIndex` allows us to define a monthly date e.g. 2021-04 (April 2021). There are no more days to subtract, just months. One month before is unambiguously March 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's convert the `timestamp` level of the index of `returns` to be a monthly `PeriodIndex`. To make this fast, we will extract all unique `timestamp` (second level i.e. `level=1` values; recall: there are many duplicates because we have multiple tickers), convert them to `PeriodIndex` using the `to_period()` method, and then set the second index level to these new values:\n"

    "To compute excess returns, we subtracted the risk-free rate from all asset log returns except for the long-short portfolio. Why? Well, let's think about what excess returns mean. They are not just the return on an asset in excess of the risk-free rate. It is also the return on an investment strategy, where one borrows a \\\\$1 at the risk-free rate and invests it in the asset. After a period, one pays back the \\\\$1 with interest and is left with the excess return as profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a long-short portfolio is self-financing i.e. one does not need to borrow any money to invest in. The short leg is already the borrowing one needs to finance the long leg. So the return on a financed long-short investment strategy is already the long-short return.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now (finally!) ready to estimate betas. We will use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to do this. There are many ways to run OLS regressions in `python`. In other classes e.g. Linear Econometrics you will learn how to do it using the `statsmodels` package, or maybe the `scikit-learn` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, since we need to run many univariate regressions, we will use the formula for the univariate OLS coefficient directly. Recall, for a linear model of the type $y_i = a + b x_i + u_i$, the OLS estimate of $b$ is given by $\\hat{b} = \\frac{ \\text{Cov}[x,y]  }{ \\text{Var}[x] }$. In our case, $x$ is the market excess return and $y$ is each asset's excess return. So we need to divide the covariance of the asset's return with the market by the variance of the market return.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the 14 x 14 covariance matrix of all assets' excess returns -- the market's and the 13 test assets. The first row of this covariance matrix will contain the covariances of each test asset with the market. The first element of the first row will be the covariance of the market return with itself i.e. its variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's convert a table of excess returns from long to wide. In addition to `pivot()`, we can use the `unstack()` method for this, which is more appropriate when the variables defining rows and columns are indices:\n"

    "Our single-stock estimated betas range from 0.34 for WMT (Walmart) to 1.98 for C (Citigroup, a financial services company). This means that, on average, when the stock market goes up by 1%, Merck's stock goes up by 0.34% while Citi's goes up by 1.98%. EW, the equal-weighted portfolio, has a beta close to 1, which makes sense. The more stock you add to a portfolio, the more it resembles the market. The long-short portfolio LS has the lowest beta of all assets at 0.28. This is the main advantage of long-short strategies. By going long some stocks and short others, they aim to immunize market exposure i.e. to bet on particular stocks while reducing the effect market fluctuations have on portfolio returns.\n",

    "To put it mildly, the CAPM predictions do not hold. If they did, the blue dots would be where the orange dots are. The relationship between betas and excess returns doesn't even appear to be positive, much less linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the work that we did in importing, cleaning, re-arranging, merging and analyzing data proved to be very useful. It showed us that our theory explaining stock returns doesn't do a very good job.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the LS and EW portfolios are pretty close to their CAPM predicted values. Perhaps the CAPM works better for portfolios than individual assets?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aside: Investigating the Failure of the CAPM\n",
    "\n",
    "So why not? There are many reasons, some simpler than others. \"Pricing\" the cross-section of stock returns i.e. explaining why some stocks have higher returns on average than others is an active ongoing field of financial research. We don't have all the answers yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put aside some theoretical reasons for CAPM's failure and focus on the more data-oriented, or empirical, ones. CAPM is written in terms of conditional one-month ahead expectations of stock returns. We don't observe these expectations in the data. Instead, we observe many _realizations_ of stock returns, which consist of an expected part and a surprise. If (1) we have many months of observations, (2) the surprises are that big relative to expectations, and (3) each month's realized return comes from the same distribution, then the surprises mostly cancel out, and the sample average of realized returns is a good estimator of the expected return. In statistics, this is known as the **Law of Large Numbers** (LLN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we said that over short horizons e.g. one year, (3) is a pretty good assumption. The distribution of stock returns, even if it varies, don't vary very fast. But over short horizons, (1) doesn't hold -- there aren't enough observations for LLN to kick in. Over longer horizons, though, expected stock returns may differ. We face a trade-off between (1) and (3). So our best bet is to deal with (2) i.e. to try to find assets for which the surprises are relatively small, such that LLN kicks in faster, and we can use relatively short samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are such such assets? Portfolios! Earlier, we saw the benefits of diversification when we constructed the EW portfolio. Diversification reduces volatility because some stock's surprises get canceled out by others'. Now, of course, if we form very large portfolios that include most stocks, we may get very few surprises but we will also get a beta of 1 for every portfolio. We won't actually be able to see if higher betas are associated with higher returns if all betas are 1. So again, we face a trade-off. We want to include enough stocks in a portfolio that the _idiosyncratic_ (i.e. asset-specific) volatility is low, but not so many as to get rid of the variety in betas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a rich literature on coming up with good _test_ portfolios i.e. portfolios we can use to test the CAPM. Let's try just one approach -- let's group stocks by industry. So rather than looking at Microsoft, Citigroup, and Merck, we'll look at portfolios of tech, financial, and pharma firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, Ken French already sorted stocks into portfolios, so we can download these portfolio returns directly.\n"
